# microfluidics
Commercial available microfluidics chips are usually for nL of droplet.

We use 3D printed negative model to creat microfluidics that is for 1-3 uL of droplet. The cross-section diameter is 1.4 mm.

I created these models by using Autodesk Fusion360 or freeCAD. The STL files are the exported files for review and printing.
